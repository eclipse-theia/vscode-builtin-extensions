# Building VS Code built-in Extensions

## Setup

1. Install the VS Code prerequisites as described in (link)
2. Open a command line inside this repo
3. Set up the version of VS Code you want to build:
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
4. Check out the version of VS code you want to use
    cd vscode
    git checkout <git tag or branch>
5. Install project dependencies
    yarn
    
## Building
Building the exensions from VS Code is done simply with 

    yarn build:extensions

This will compile a production ("minified") version of the built-in extensions into the `vscode/.build` folder. In order to produce unminified versions for debugging,
you will need to edit the build script at `vscode/build/lib/extensions.js`. Find the line that creates the webpack config. It should look like this:
```
const webpackConfig = {
   ...config,
   ...{ mode: 'production' }
};
```
Remove part saying `mode: production` and redo the build

## Packaging

### Packaging the built-in vscode extensions

Once we have built our extensions, we can packge them into `*.vsix`-files using this package script:

    yarn package-vsix:latest

The script will produce `*.vsix` files in a folder called `./dist`. The vsix files will be named like `<name>-<vscode-version>.vsix`. Note that the publisher (msvscode)
is not included.

If you want to create a prerelease version, you can do so by invoking 

    yarn package-vsix:next

This will generate `*.vsix` files of the form `<name>-<vscode-version>-next.<commit hash>.vsix`

**Implementation Note:** the VS Code build process puts some shared depenencies in a `node_modules` folder which is located in the "extensions" folder at run time. In order to 
produce self-contained extensions, we need to include those modules (at the time, it's the typescript language server) into the packaged extensions (currently for `typescript-language-features` and `html-language-features`). The code doing this is located in `src/package-vsix.js`. We also need to patch the `typescript-language-features`
extension because it contains a hard-code reference to `../node_modules`.

### Creating the built-ins extension-pack

We also create an extension pack from the internal and external built-ins into the `dist` folder with a package script. The file name will be of the form:
builtin-extension-pack-<vscode version>.vsix.

   yarn create-extension-pack:latest

Again, we can produce a preview release of the form `builtin-extension-pack-<vscode version>-next-.vsix

    yarn create-extension-pack:next

Note that you will have to package the `next` versions of the built-in extensions before they can be included in a `next` extensions pack.
