## Publishing vscode-builtin-extensions to npm

    // bump to publish
    let version = '0.2.1';

Create a npm user and login to the npm registry, [more on npm publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

    npm login

Publish packages with lerna to update versions properly across local packages, [more on publishing with lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#publish).

    npx lerna publish

## Packaging vscode-builtin-extensions as individual `.vsix`

The version of the packaged built-ins is taken from VS Code's `package.json` and adjusted automatically when packaging a `next` revision.

Latest / solid revision example:

    cd vscode; git checkout 1.45.0; cd ..
    yarn; yarn package-vsix:latest

Next / interim revision example:

    cd vscode; git checkout d69a79b73808559a91206d73d7717ff5f798f23c; cd ..
    yarn; yarn package-vsix:next

The generated `.vsix` will be under folder `./dist`

## Publishing vscode-builtin-extensions to open-vsx

The `ovsx` client is used to publish to an open-vsx registry. By default https://open-vsx.org is used. To use another open-vsx registry, set its URL in environment variable `OVSX_REGISTRY_URL`. Use enviromnent variable `OVSX_PAT` to store the personal access token obtained from the registry.

After packaging the extensions as `.vsix` (see above), you may examine/test them under folder `dist`. Remove any that you do not wish to be published (e.g. those not working well). When ready proceed with publishing:

    yarn publish:vsix
